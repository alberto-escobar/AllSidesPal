instead of having a bunch of functions for searching as and MBFC in background.js, 
I created a script that is imported using importScript and contains 3 classes. They are:
Database
MBFC_Database (extends Database)
AS_Database (extends Database)

in each class, the methods for searching URLs will be contained with in. with the search function outputing the best matching result
the search algorithm would be containined in the Database class

IF NO RESULT APPEARS, RETURN undefined. STOP USING "no data", it is an annoying nomenclature to use.
